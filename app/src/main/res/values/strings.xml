        TicTacToe is a pencil-and-paper game
        for two players, X and O, who take
        turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid.
        The X player usually goes first. The
        player who succeeds in placing three
        respective marks in a horizontal,
        vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
